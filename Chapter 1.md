# The Man's Perspective: Winning a Woman's Heart

## Courtyard

The first phase of a relationship.

### Gate

There is one correct way to enter a relationship.

> "Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber. 2 But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. 3 To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out. 4 And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice. 5 And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers. 6 This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them. 7 Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep. 8 All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them. 9 I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture. 10 The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly" (John 10:1-10).

This passage speaks of two parts of the entrance: the door and the porter. The door explicitly represents Jesus. The porter could be seen to represent a girl's father or some other responsible figure in her life.

A young man's willingness or unwillingness to pass through the door by permission of the porter reveals his intent--whether he is there to kill and steal, or to bring life.
